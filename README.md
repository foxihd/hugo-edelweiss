This is my implementation of a minimalist and (almost) no-js hugo theme that is optimized for bilingual single author,
 since I found hugo-brewm is like a big house, perhaps.
However, this theme is compatible with hugo-brewm configs & parameters.
And yeah, this theme looks good with Times New Roman, if you find that's a problem.
This theme is used at my site ([https://foxx.ink](https://foxx.ink)).
And you can see how it's configured on [https://tangled.org/808.foxx.ink/test](https://tangled.org/808.foxx.ink/test).
